  abstract      = {The CAD design process includes a number of repetitive steps when creating assemblies. This issue is compounded when engineering whole product lines or design families, as steps like inserting parts common to all variations, such as fasteners and product-integral base parts, get repeated numerous times. This makes creating designs time-, and as a result, cost-intensive. While many CAD software packages have APIs, the effort of creating use-case specific plugins to automate creation of assemblies usually outweighs the benefit. We developed a plugin for the CAD software package "Fusion 360" which tackles this issue. The plugin adds several graphical interfaces to Fusion 360 that allow parts to be annotated with types, subtype hierarchies to be managed, and requests to synthesize assembly programs for assemblies to be posed. The plugin is use-case agnostic and is able to generate arbitrary open kinematic chain structures. We envision engineers working with CAD software being able to make designed parts reusable and automate the generation of different design alternatives as well as whole product lines.},

  abstract  = {In many machine scheduling studies, individual algorithms for each problem have been developed to cope with the specifics of the problem. On the other hand, the same underlying fundamentals (e.g. Shortest Processing Time, Local Search) are often used in the algorithms and only slightly modified for the different problems. This paper deals with the synthesis of machine scheduling algorithms from components of a repository. Especially flow shop and job shop problems with makespan objective are considered to solve with Shortes/Longest Processing Time, NEH, Giffler {\&} Thompson algorithms. For these components, the paper includes an exemplary implementation of an agile scheduling system that uses the Combinatory Logic Synthesizer to recombine components of scheduling algorithms to solve a given scheduling problem. Special attention is given to the composition heuristics and the process of recombination to executable programs. The advantages of this componentization are discussed and illustrated with examples. It will be shown that algorithms can be generalized to deal with scheduling problems of different machine environments and production constraints.},
