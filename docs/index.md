## About
This is just a suggestion text. 

**CoSy** is short for **Co**mbinatory **Sy**nthesizer. 
It is an easy to use, comfortable, even cosy, framework that allows synthesizing target artifacts from modular compontents. 
Due to the domain-agnostic nature of the framework (while implemented in python, arbitrary artifacts can be created), 
it is by-and-large applicable to any use-case that benefits or inherently makes use of modularization. 

## Papers
There is a large body of work concerning combinatory logic synthesis, utilizing CoSy (formerly known as the CLS-framework). 
It has been utilized for robotics, logistics, CAD assemblies, factory planning, and many more. 
An overview over relevant literature, split into applications of CoSy and the theory behind it, is found in the following.
